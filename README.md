## GOLANG Microservice

I tried to enhance microservice from this repo https://github.com/raycad/go-microservices. It's unmaintained and some packages is already out of date. because that repo created 6 years ago. my work of enhancment will be tracked at this repo.

# List of Enhancements

User Microservice:

- Add more logs
- Password hashing implementation
- Update JWT Package to maintained one
- Update MongoDB Package to maintained one
- Update Logrus Package to maintained one
- Add password hashing check at login process
- Batching implementation at get all users process
- Regex implementation at search user by username funcionality, so now don't need full username to search user
- Add more error response handling for error code 400. now it has error for bad response and data not found
